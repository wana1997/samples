# Simple Happy Path Client Script for UCP SDK.

## Scope

This script demonstrates a complete "happy path" user journey: 0. **Discovery**:
Querying the merchant to see what they support. 1. **Create Checkout**: Creating
a new checkout session (cart). 2. **Add Items**: Adding items to the checkout
session. 3. **Fulfillment**: Triggering fulfillment option generation, selecting
a destination, and choosing a shipping option. 4. **Complete**: Completing the
checkout by processing a payment.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Install Dependencies**: `bash uv sync`

2.  **Start the Merchant Server**: You need a running UCP Merchant Server to
    execute this client against. Follow the instructions in the
    [Server README](../../server/README.md) to start the server on port 8182.

    *Quick start (from `../../server/`):* `bash uv run server.py
    --products_db_path=/tmp/ucp_test/products.db
    --transactions_db_path=/tmp/ucp_test/transactions.db --port=8182`

## Running the Client

Once the server is running, you can execute the client script:

```bash
uv run simple_happy_path_client.py --server_url=http://localhost:8182
```

### Options

*   `--server_url`: The base URL of the UCP Merchant Server (default:
    `http://localhost:8182`).
*   `--export_requests_to`: Path to a markdown file where the request/response
    dialog will be logged.

    ```bash
    uv run simple_happy_path_client.py --export_requests_to=interaction_log.md
    ```

## Automated Demo (extract_json_dialog.sh)

For a fully automated demonstration that sets up the database, starts the
server, runs the client, and generates a transaction log, use the included shell
script:

```bash
./extract_json_dialog.sh
```

This will output the interaction log to `/tmp/ucp_test/happy_path_dialog.md`.
